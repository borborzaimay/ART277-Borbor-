<h1 style="font-size:10px">Ref: Albert Momo University Application</h1><hr>
<p style="font-size:10px"> Dear Mr. Momo,</p>
<p style="font-size: 10px;text-style: Times new Roman">Thank you for your recent application to join us at Starz University's Science faculty to study as part of your <abbr title="Doctor of Philosophy">PhD</abbr> next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.</p>
<h2 style= "font-size: 10px"> Starting dates</h2>
<p style= "font-size: 10px"> We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you could start at the beginning of a semester, the start dates for each one are as follows:</p>
<p style="font-size: 10px"> First semester:9 October 2022
<br>Second semester:15 January 2023 <br> Third Semester: 2 May 2023</p>
<p style= "font-size: 10px"> Pleas let me know if this is ok, , and if so which start date you would prefer. </p>
<p style="font-size:10px"> You can find more information about important University dates on your website</p><p></p>
<h3 style= "font-size:10px">Subjects of study</h3><p></p>
<p style="font-size:10px;text-style: Times new Roman"> At the Starz University, we have a pretty open-minded research facility _as long as the subjects fall somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows, in order of priority:</p>
<p style 
="font-size:10px"> Turing H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub></sub></sub></sub></sub>)
<br> Measuring the effect on performance of funk bass players at temperatures exceeding 30<sup>o</sup>C (86<sup>o</sup>f), when the audience size exponentially increases(effect of 3x10<sup>4</sup>)</sup></sup></sup></p>
<p> <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</abbr > consists for representing musical scores</p>
<p style="font-size:10px"> So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the research to take, required staff and other resources,  and anything else you think we'd  need to know? Thanks</p>
<h4 style="font-size:10px">Exotic dance moves</h4>
<p style="font-size:10px"> Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:</p>
<dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt><dd> A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC,but a whole village would dance around in circle like chickens to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful"</dd>
<dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt>
<dd>Before the celanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they sed to practice this dance, which involved hdding close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow studentse used to say that he thought this dance inspired modern styles such as Twerking </dd>
<dt>Arctic robot dance </dt><dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers is the 1960s believe to have discovered a new dance style characterized by "robotic", stilted movements,  being practied by inhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this because they were really cold.</dd>
<p style="font-size: 10px"> For more of my research, see my exotic dance research page.</p><p></p>
<p style="font-size:10px"> Yours sincerely.</p><p></p>
